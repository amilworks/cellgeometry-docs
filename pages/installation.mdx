<Steps>
 
### Step 1
 
Clone the repository:

   ```
 
### Step 2
 
Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash copy
   cd cells/cells/streamlit

### Step 3

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv env
   ```

### Step 4

Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash copy
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
