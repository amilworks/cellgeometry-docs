# ⚙️ Installation

To install and set up the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash copy 
   gh repo clone bioshape-lab/cells
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash copy
   cd cells/cells/streamlit
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash copy
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash copy
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash copy
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash copy
   poetry install
   ```

   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, resolves dependencies, and installs them into the virtual environment.

6. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash copy
   streamlit run Hello.py
   ```

   The Streamlit app should now be running locally. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

> __Note:__ Make sure you have Python and Poetry installed on your machine before following these steps. The `pyproject.yaml` file should contain the necessary dependencies and their versions, enabling Poetry to manage the installation process effectively.
