# Introduction
 
## 📝 Project Description 

This project focuses on the analysis and comparison of biological cell shapes using elastic metrics implemented in Geomstats. The shapes of biological cells are determined by various processes and biophysical forces, which play a crucial role in cellular functions. By utilizing quantitative measures that reflect cellular morphology, this project aims to leverage large-scale biological cell image data for morphological studies.

The analysis of cell shapes has significant applications in various domains. One notable application is the accurate classification and discrimination of cancer cell lines treated with different drugs. Measures of irregularity and spreading of cells can provide valuable insights for understanding the effects of drug treatments.

## ⚙️ Installation

To install and set up the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone bioshape-lab/cells
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cells/cells/streamlit
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, resolves dependencies, and installs them into the virtual environment.

6. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Hello.py
   ```

   The Streamlit app should now be running locally. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

> __Note:__ Make sure you have Python and Poetry installed on your machine before following these steps. The `pyproject.yaml` file should contain the necessary dependencies and their versions, enabling Poetry to manage the installation process effectively.
